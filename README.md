## About the Developer

I am a professional Unity game developer with 5+ years of hands-on experience
designing, engineering, and shipping interactive game systems.

My work focuses on building **clean, maintainable, and scalable gameplay
architectures** that perform well across mobile and desktop platforms.
I approach game development with an engineering mindset — prioritizing structure,
performance, and long-term extensibility over quick hacks.

From concept to production, I design systems that teams can grow with.

## Development Philosophy

I don’t just build features — I build systems.

My focus is on:
- Clean code with clear responsibility boundaries  
- Scalable architectures that survive production growth  
- Performance-aware design decisions  
- Reusable frameworks instead of one-off solutions  

Every system is designed to be readable, testable, and extendable.
